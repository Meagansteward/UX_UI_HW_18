                <h3>Leadership & Team Management</h3>
                <p>I effectively delegate tasks and ensure collaborative success, alongside over 5 years of clinical experience in managing a dental practice autonomously, demonstrating leadership, and supporting my team. This combination allows me to approach UX design with a strong emphasis on empathy, precision, and effective team management.</p>

                <h3>Communication & Care</h3>
                <p>UX focuses on gaining insights from user experiences and fostering empathy to create better products aligns with my natural skills of empathy and compassion, honed over 7+ years of patient care. In pediatrics, I consistently met my young patients at their level, helping to eliminate their fears and create a comfortable environment, ensuring their appointments were enjoyable.</p>

                <h3>Problem Solving & Critical Thinking</h3>
                <p>In UX design, I apply quick problem-solving skills to address user experience challenges and iterate on design solutions efficiently. Similarly, my clinical experience in patient care has honed my ability to be decisive in creating treatment plans that effectively address patients' complaints and pains.
